The dinosaur is made of 31 pieces (not including the head phone). I use box, cylinder, and sphere geometry to model the dinosaur. When it moves, its head is shaking, and its legs, feet, and arms are moving. Its tail, which is composed of 5 cylinders, is shaking too.

The volcano is made of a cylinder, mapped with a volcano picture I found online. The eruption is modeled using 1000 spheres, and each of them following the law of gravity.

The background is a picture of stars shining in the galaxy. There are 5 lights from East, West, North, South, and Top so the scene is bright and shining.

The background music is a song written by my friend Jeemin.

Control:
"b" - play the motion backwards in time
"l" - turn on or off lighting
"f" - flip the dino
"q" - steer left
"w" - steer right
