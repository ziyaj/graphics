I have not used any of the grace days so far, so I will use my grace days for this
assignment.

I changed kSpec and kLocal as Piazza post @229 suggests to make the image color
look like the picture in assignment description.

For creative components, I have done the following:
- Phong shading
- refraction
- moving texture map background

Even though there are a lot of effects I can do, I'd like to have a clean finish!
So I only chose phong shading, refraction, and a background. It has been a really
nice journey in computer graphics! Farewell, CPSC 314, Michiel and lovely TAs...
