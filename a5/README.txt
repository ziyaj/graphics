NOTES:

Press "R" to rain.

The explosion ball code is copied from an online tutorial https://www.clicktorelease.com/blog/vertex-displacement-noise-3d-webgl-glsl-three-js/
I read the code and understand what it is doing and change the parameters accordingly to make it fix into the scene.

The ball in the middle, the mirror, the armadillo, and also all rain drops if you hit "R", do mirror reflection correctly on all 6 faces of the sky box.

The middle bottom ball uses envmapMaterial to satisfy the grading requirement for reflection only 1 face of the skybox.

The floor has a unique shader that rotates the texture map coordinates over time, so it is rotating.
